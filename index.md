The objective of Robotics I & II is for students to learn about the analysis and design of robotic systems, with a focus on kinematics, coordinate
transformation, and modeling. This course is designed to allow students to gain proficiency in the basics of robotic design and analysis,
focusing on forward kinematics of linkages, actuation and feedback, motion control, sensors, and machine vision by having practical labs
that apply the theoretical concepts learned from the lecture.
