## Lab Objective

This lab`s objective is to prepare you for the different upcoming labs of Robotic System courses 
by installing the necessary software. While this lab has no grade value, it is meant to help 
prevent future delays caused by needing to stop and install these software programs later.

## Deliverable

- [ ] Nothing needs to be submitted or demonstrated for this lab.

## General Steps for Completion of Lab

### Step 1 - Install PSoC Creator

The CY8CKIT-059 PSoC 5LP Development Boards need the PSoC Creator™ integrated design environment (IDE) for programming. You will 
need to go to <https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/psoc-software/psoc-creator/> to download this software. 

The link will open to a page like <strong>Figure 1</strong>. Click the Download icon that the yellow arrow is pointing to.

</figure>  

Then another window will open to verify the operating system and version of PSoC Creator you want to download, as 
shown in <strong>Figure 2.</strong>

Before downloading, it will ask you to log into <strong>Infineon</strong>, as shown in <strong>Figure 3.</strong>. You 
will need to sign into your account or create a new one.

The first step is to verify where to install the PSoC Creator, as shown in <strong>Figure 4.</strong> You 
can either accept the default location or change it.

The second item to decide on is the “Installation Type” you want to install. We will go with <strong>Typical</strong> 
as shown in <strong>Figure 5.</strong>

Then, it will ask you to accept the terms of the two license agreements as shown in <strong>Figure 6.</strong>

Finally, the software will begin to install.

When the installation is finished, you have a few choices on how you want to <strong>Finish</strong> as 
shown in <strong>Figure 8</strong>.
