## Lab Objective

Ensure that you can control a DC motor speed and reinforce the subject matter covered in the lecture on "DC Motors and Encoders."

## Deliverable

- [ ] <ins>In-class demonstration</ins> with the LCD screen displaying a reading of the RPM/speed from one of the many runs used in finding the motor velocity constant (K<sub>V</sub>).

- [ ] <ins>In-class demonstration</ins> with the LCD screen displaying the RPM/actual speed for your torque load and being able to tell what your predicted speed for that torque rating.  

- [ ] <ins>A Canvas submitted</ins> document that contains the following items:

    - [ ] The calculation and result for figuring out your Count Per Revolution (CPR).
    
    - [ ] The steps for finding the motor velocity constant (K<sub>V</sub>) via a single reading.
    
    - [ ] Table and graph for finding the K<sub>V</sub> via a linear trendline fit.  
        * Table has a Title.
        * The table`s columns are labeled.
        * Graph has a Title.
        * Both graph axes are labeled, and unit values are given as needed.
        * A trendline that was formed from the points on the graph.
        * The trendline formula is shown along with the fit value of r<sup>2</sup>.

    - [ ] The method used to determine the linear line equation for Torque vs Speed.
        * If by equation, show the steps to calculate the equation.
        * If by trendline, show the graph for the Torque vs Speed along with the Table used to generate the graph.
        * The graph should include the title.
        * Both graph axes are labeled, and unit values are given as needed.
        * The trendline formula is shown along with the fit value of r2.
        * Show the reworked equation to have Torque as the input.
        * The mass or torque used to determine the predicted motor speed.
        * Compare the predicted and resulting motor speed for that torque load.


## General Step for Completion of Lab

### Step 1: Prep the DC Motor Wire Harness.
<details open markdown="block">
<summary>To Hide Details</summary>

To make it easier to connect the motor and encoder wires to the controller, it is <strong>strongly suggested</strong> that you <ins>solder six
of your jumper wires</ins> to each of the wires of the motor wire harness, similar to what is shown in <strong>Figure 1:</strong>.

{: .new-title}
> NOTE
>
>   * It would suggest using either the Male-to-Female or Female-to-Female jumper wires.
>   * Cut off the the Female connector and stripe the the end.
>   * If using heat-shirk to protect the wire connection, make sure it is on the wire <strong>before</strong> soldewring the wirwes together.
>   * To avoid confusion later, use jumper wires that have the <ins>same</ins> color.
