## Lab Objective

Ensure that you can control a DC motor speed and reinforce the subject matter covered in the lecture on "DC Motors and Encoders."

## Deliverable

- [ ] <ins>In-class demonstration</ins> with the LCD screen displaying a reading from one of the many steps in finding the velocity constant.

- [ ] <ins>In-class demonstration</ins> with the LCD screen displaying the RPM/actual speed for your torque load and being able to tell what your predicted speed for that torque rating.  

- [ ] <ins>A Canvas submitted</ins> document that contains the following items:

    - [ ] The calculation and result for figuring out your Count Per Revolution (CPR).
    
    - [ ] The steps for finding the motor velocity constant (K<sub>V</sub>) via a single reading.
    
    - [ ] Table and graph for finding the K<sub>V</sub> via a linear trendline fit.  
        * Table has a Title.
        * The table`s columns are labeled.
        * Graph has a Title.
        * Both graph axes are labeled, and unit values are given as needed.
        * A trendline that was formed from the points on the graph.
        * The trendline formula is shown along with the fit value of r<sup>2</sup>.

    - [ ] Table and graph for the Torque vs Speed graph.
        * Graph to include Title.
        * Axis labels showing units.
    - [ ] The torque value to check the predicted motor speed (table or graph)
        * The predicted motor speed (table or graph)
        * The resulting motor speed at that torque load
