## Lab Objective

Ensure that you can control a DC motor speed and reinforce the motor's constant concepts and motor torque.

## Deliverable

- [ ] Two in-class checks with the LCD screen displaying your motor speed in rpm.
    
    **1)** A reading from the **many** readings while finding the velocity constant.
    
    **2)** Show your speed comparison between predicted and actual speed for your torque load.

- [ ] Submit to Canvas ta document with the following gathered data from your finding:
    
    - [ ] Count per revolution (CPR)
    - [ ] Calculation for finding the velocity constant (KV) via a single reading.
    - [ ] Table and graph for finding the KV via a linear trendline fit.  
        * Graph to include Title.
        * Axis labels showing units, if applicable
        * the linear trendline with the r2
    - [ ] Table and graph for the Torque vs Speed graph.
      * Graph to include Title.
      * Axis labels showing units.
    - [ ] The torque value to check the predicted motor speed (table or graph)
        * The predicted motor speed (table or graph)
        * The resulting motor speed at that torque load
